* __About me__
    * I solely maintain and develop plotly's R package (part time).
    * PhD in statistics from Iowa State University (ABD).
    * Expert in the intersection of R, web technologies, and data visualization.
    * Novice disease outbreak analyst.
* __Why R?__
    * R is a __free__ and __open__-source statistical programming language.
    * A __huge__ community:
        * Over __9000 user contributed packages currently__ on CRAN (best source for latest statistical methodology)
        * The package __surveillance__ implements outbreak detection methods from 13 different publications!
        * Numerous organization support R development ([R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/home/), [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), etc)

    
## About plotly

* R package builds upon [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) (open-source JavaScript graphing library)
* Plotly has other interfaces to plotly.js (Python, Julia, MATLAB, Ruby).
* Share, collaborate, & modify via web platform (public: free, private: costs)

## An example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(measles, x = ~date, y = ~count, color = ~district, mode = "lines")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(surveillance)
library(plotly)
data("measles.weser")
measles <- data.frame(measles.weser$observed)
measles$date <- seq(as.Date("2001-01-01"), by = "week", length.out = NROW(measles))
measles <- tidyr::gather(measles, district, count, -date)
measles$district <- sub("^X", "", measles$district)
measles$txt <- with(measles, paste0("Date: ", date, "<br />", "Count: ", count))
measles %>%
  crosstalk::SharedData$new(~district) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~count, color = ~district, text = ~txt) %>%
  add_lines(hoverinfo = "text+name") %>%
  crosstalk("plotly_hover")
```

# What if there are _many_ areas of interest?

## Visualization mantras

Statistical graphics perspective:

> Visualizations can surprise you, but don't scale well.
> Modeling scales well, but can't surprise you.
>
> --- Hadley Wickham

Information visualization perspective:

> Overview first, then zoom and filter, then details on demand.
>
