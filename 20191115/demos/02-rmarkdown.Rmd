To embed **plotly** inside **rmarkdown**, just place it in a code chunk: 

```{r, message = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, color = ~clarity, colors = "Accent")
```

The **DT** package is another htmlwidget, designed for creating interactive tables.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(DT)

diamonds %>% 
  count(cut, clarity) %>%
  datatable()
```
