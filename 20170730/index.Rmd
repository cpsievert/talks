## What won this award? Linked views _without __shiny___ via **plotly**

# What do mean _without shiny_? Why does it matter?

.footnote[
Of course, you can link views _with shiny_!

## What's happening under-the-hood?

Joe Cheng (**crosstalk** author) envisioned _1-to-1 linking_ with _transient selection_ (e.g., scatterplot-matrix brushing)

**plotly** supports m-to-n linking, transient & persistent selection, dynamic coloring, dynamic aggregation, direct/indirect manipulation, and more!

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE,
  fig.width = 10,
  fig.height = 4,
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  eval = FALSE
)
```

```r
library(plotly)
*library(crosstalk)
*sd <- SharedData$new(txhousing, ~year)
p <- ggplot(sd, aes(month, median, group = year)) + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~city, ncol = 2)
(gg <- ggplotly(p, tooltip = "year"))
```

## Making comparisons with dynamic brush

```{r}
highlight(
  gg, dynamic = TRUE, persistent = TRUE, selectize = TRUE
)
```

<iframe src="10.html" width="100%" height="420" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0"> </iframe>

---
## Customize selection rendering

```{r}
highlight(
  gg, dynamic = TRUE, persistent = TRUE, 
  selected = attrs_selected(mode = "markers+lines", marker = list(symbol = "x"))
)
```

## Link different chart types (+ dynamic aggregates!)

    * Learned about reproducibility & collaboration (e.g., knitr, git, GitHub)<sup>1</sup>
    
* __May 2013:__ Internship with Kenny Shirley at AT&T
    * Learned about lack of tools for _exploratory_ web graphics
    
* __May 2014:__ Google Summer of Code with Toby Dylan Hocking<sup>2</sup>
    * Learned about converting __ggplot2__ from static to interactive

* __2015:__ Part-time consultant for plotly<sup>2</sup>
    * Learned how to get paid for doing "research" 

* __2017:__ Defended PhD. Started consulting full-time.
    * Clients: plotly, NOAA, O'Reilly, BC Gov, Univ of Helsinki, and NYC Data Science

[1]: Want your students to be more employable? Teach them git/GitHub!!! <br />
[2]: Wouldn't have been possible without git/GitHub knowledge!

## Go forth, impact open-source!

* To students:
    * Learn by reading (source code), building, and _making mistakes_ (publically!)
    * Leverage your community (mailing lists, Twitter, etc). Develop online presence.
    * Learn how to collaborate remotely (git/GitHub)
    * Works towards tomorrow, not today
        * Learn a little about many areas -- pay-off is exponential!
        * Fail quickly, be ready for the next big thing

* To mentors:
    * Be a good role-model: _use & contribute to open-source!_
    * Hold working groups: _demand presentations_!
    * Help students refine scope/focus _without telling them what to do_
        * General-purpose tools are hard to maintain

* To the academic community:
    * Valuable contribution takes time, _account for that when hiring_
    * Publications aren't everything!
        * Consider other metrics (e.g., downloads, page views, etc)
        * Helping others get pubs often isn't rewarded, we _suck_ at citing open source!
