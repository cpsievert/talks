## Why interactive/dynamic graphics?

* Why interactive/dynamic graphics for _presentation_?
    * Aids communication in some way
        * Test assumptions, alter parameters, and/or explore details
* Why interactive/dynamic graphics for _exploration_?
    * Generate insight _faster_ (iteration time is crucial!!!). 
        * Identify structure that might otherwise go missing ([Tukey 1972](http://stat-graphics.org/movies/prim9.html))
        * Find Gestalt, pose queries, and make comparisons ([Cook, Buja, & Swayne 2007](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390754))
        * Explore, understand, and diagnose statistical model fit(s) ([Wickham, Cook, & Hofmann 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sam.11271/abstract)).
    
* Why _web_ graphics?
    * simple to share, portable (web browser)
    * encourages composability

# _Web_ graphics usually aren't _practical_ for _exploring_ data

Good for presentation (viz type is _known_), bad for exploration (viz type is _unknown_)
