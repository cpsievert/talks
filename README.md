# talks

Slides for various talks I've given. You can browse them on the homepage -- <http://cpsievert.github.io/talks> 

## Note to self

To create a new slide deck give `new.R` a date in form YYYYMMDD

```shell
Rscript new.R 20160131
```

The second argument is optional, in case we want a different template someday:

```shell
Rscript new.R 20160131 ioslides
```

To update the homepage/table:

```shell
Rscript table.R
```
